IT IS NECESSARY TO HAVE SCIKIT-LEARN AND NUMPY INSTALLED

In an Linux environment, simply run the command below in 
order to compile the program

./compile

If a cleanup is desired, the command below is sufficient

make clean

Then, if the compilation was successfull, you can perform one
of the commands below in order to obtain the results from each
approach

./runBelemEtAl.sh <path/to/image> <path/of/result>
./runWithLinReg.sh <path/to/image> <path/of/result>
./runWithGLCM.sh <path/to/image> <path/of/result>
./runWithSVR.sh <path/to/image> <path/of/result>
./runWithRF.sh <path/to/image> <path/of/result>

The segmentation algorithm is based on the previous work of Bel√©m
et al., which is an extension of the work of Cousty et al.
